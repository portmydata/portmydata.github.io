## **Port My Data wants your help to ensure a functioning right to data portability.** ##

### _What is this?_ ###

Article 20 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives a data subject the right to data portability.

In particular, the right allows data subjects to request that personal data that has been provided to a service is:

* Returned in a machine readable format (Article 20 (1))

* Directly transmitted to a second service (Article 20 (2))

For more details as to the right, review the ICO guidance [here](https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-to-data-portability/).

### _Why should you care?_ ###

The right to data portability is one that is intended to give data subjects more power over their data.  Our findings suggest that it does not function as intended.

Do you want to exercise the right? Follow our [how to guide](/exercise/).

If youâ€™ve tried to exercise the right, share your story! Contact us on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/portmydata).

### _What will we do?_ ###

**We want to hear your stories.**

Stories showing how the right doesn't work or about instances of data portability that would be useful to you -
these are important to show that this right is worth fighting for.

Without being able to show that data subjects want a functioning Article 20, there may never _be_ a functioning
Article 20.

Tell us about your data portability experiences - or wishes - on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/portmydata).

### _How did this project come about?_ ###

Port My Data is the result of a Master's project exploring the ability of data
subjects to exercise the right to data portability afforded under Article 20 GDPR.

It is a joint project of [UCL Department of Science, Technology Engineering and Public Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/steapp) and [Open Rights Group](https://www.openrightsgroup.org), and funded in part by [PETRAS IoT Research Hub](https://www.petrashub.org/).
