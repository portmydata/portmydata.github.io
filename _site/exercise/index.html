<p>Under <em><strong>Article 20(1)</strong></em> you can ask a service provider to give you personal data that you have provided to them.
You can then reuse this data as you like - including asking other service providers to ingest it.</p>

<p>Under <em><strong>Article 20(2)</strong></em> you can ask a service provider that you have provided personal data to to transmit
that personal data directly to another service provider.</p>

<p>There are various ways you can request this, depending upon the service provider you are contacting.</p>

<p>You can <strong>download a template letter</strong> for sending or emailing here. Service providers should have <strong>contact details</strong> within their privacy policy (or you can check <a href="https://datarightsfinder.org">datarightsfinder.org</a>).</p>

<p>If the service provider has a <strong>web portal</strong> that you can log into, you may find that they have automatic download (and upload) facilities.  These automatic download/upload facilities <em>may or may not</em> provide you exactly the data you have a right to under Article 20 GDPR. It is unlikely that you can facilitate any direct transmission of data between service providers in this way.</p>

<p>Service providers may require you to <strong>contact customer services</strong> to request your data.</p>

<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>

<p>We have two types of template - letter, and <a href="#email">e-mail</a>.</p>

<p>These templates cover three scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Contacting a data controller under Article 20(1) to request your data be returned to you</li>
  <li>Contacting a data controller under Article 20(1) to request that they receive your data</li>
  <li>Contacting a data controller under Article 20(2) to request that they facilitate direct transmission of you data to another data controller.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="letters">Letters</h3>

<p>Letters are available in .docx and .odt format. Click the link in the below table to download.</p>

<h3 id="email">E-mails</h3>

<p>Here are suggested body texts for each scenario:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Article 20(1) to <a href="#return">request your data be returned to you</a></li>
  <li>Article 20(1) to <a href="#takein">request that they receive your data</a></li>
  <li>Article 20(2) to <a href="#direct">request that they facilitate direct transmission</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, I wish to transmit my personal data to you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.  This data is in <em><strong>[file format]</strong></em>, with <em><strong>[type of information – e.g. step data, search history]</strong></em> within it. I would be happy to provide further details should they be necessary.</p>

<p>I appreciate that Article 20(1) GDPR does not provide details as to how it expects data controllers to receive such data from a data subject. I would be grateful if you could reply to me to confirm receipt of the request and also to confirm whether transmission of the relevant personal data is possible.</p>

<p>If it is not possible, please could you further explain if there are any alternative methods of moving my personal data to your service (for example, through existing APIs).</p>

<p>If it is possible, please could you explain the most secure method for me to transmit this data to you.</p>

<p>I appreciate that Article 20(2) GDPR requires the transmission of data only where doing so is technically feasible.  I would be grateful if you could reply to me to confirm receipt of the request and also to confirm whether direct transmission of the relevant personal data is technically feasible. If it is not, please could you further explain if there are any alternative methods of moving my personal data between your service and theirs (for example, through existing APIs).</p>

<p>Name: <em><strong>[name, if applicable]</strong></em></p>
